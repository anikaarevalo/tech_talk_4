# Tech talk 4: Emojis 😂, 😃, 🧘🏻‍♂️, 🌍, 🌦️, 🍞, 🚗, 📞, 🎉, ❤️, 🍆, 🏁


## Description ✍️ 
Emojis are a phenomenon to reckon with. An acquired taste for some while nuisance to others, I make an argument in this tech talk in defence of computer language in pictures. I argue that ***emojis are not simply low prestige electronic media worthy of serious technical study***. On the contrary, there are certain contexts where emojis aren't only acceptable--they are also quite suitable. 

This tech talk consists of the following:
- A brief background on emojis 📖
- How emojis can be integrated with python code given specific practical situations 🤔; and   
- What's next for emojis: as cultural phenomenon and as AI application 🔮

## Installation 🔌
For this no-frills yet fun demo, I'm running **python** (version 3.9) code🐍👩‍💻  accentuated with computer emojis using **jupyter ipynb🔟.**. 

## Usage 💻 
Spruce up your python code with emojis when you are:
- Introducing code to a children or novices to computer programming language 🧒🏻, 🧒🏼, 🧒🏽, 🧒🏾, 🧒🏿 , 🧒
- Presenting your python project to clients without a solid programming background 
- Making your data visuals more engaging 📈, 📉, 📊

## Personal situation 👩🏻‍🏫 👨‍🏫
As a component of our training in AI Data Operations at BeCode (Ghent, Belgium), learners of data science such as myself are required to give a brief oral presentation, on occasion, about a topic we deem is AI-relevant. As individuals still learning the ropes of this massive domain in data science, I have chosen topics of my tech talk (including this latest one) that are significant to me on a personal level too. I hope to share my own interest with others in this way. Cheers! 🥂
